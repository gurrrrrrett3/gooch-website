                So you may have seen the screenshot. <br />
                <br />This screenshot is falsified. <br />
                <br />The supposed "penis" is actually a "T", but it's flipped upside down. This is part of a larger wording spelling out my name, "Gucci Garrett" <br />
                <br />I also think you should fire the "Staff" "Member" "wxtnessed" as he has personally falsified this screenshot as a hate crime against me. I request that he gets fired immediately. <br /><br> For more info please refer to
                <a href="https://gooch.dev/assets/local/html/appeal">This Page</a>.
                <br />Thank you for your time.
            </p>
